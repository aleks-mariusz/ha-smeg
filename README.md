# SmegConnect — Unofficial Home Assistant Integration

[![HACS Custom](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/aleks-mariusz/smegconnect-homeassistant)

An unofficial Home Assistant integration for Smeg smart appliances — ovens, blast chillers, dishwashers, and wine coolers — connected via the SmegConnect cloud platform.

> **Status:** Pre-release / beta. Tested on SOP6606WS2PNR (oven) and SBC4604WNR1 (blast chiller). Reverse-engineered from the SmegConnect and SmegConnect Plus Android apps.

## What is SmegConnect?

SmegConnect is Smeg's cloud platform for controlling smart appliances remotely via a mobile app. Appliances connect to the Smeg cloud (hosted on AWS) and receive commands and push real-time state updates over MQTT. This integration connects to the same cloud API, giving you control and monitoring from Home Assistant without any local network access required.

**Architecture:** `HA → Smeg Cloud REST API + STOMP/WebSocket → AWS IoT MQTT → Appliance`

The appliance connects outbound to the Smeg cloud; there is no supported local control API after provisioning.

## SmegConnect vs SmegConnect Plus

Smeg publishes two companion apps — **SmegConnect** (ovens, dishwashers, wine coolers) and **SmegConnect Plus** (blast chillers, with dishwashers in transition). Despite the separate apps, they share the same cloud backend, the same account, and the same credentials. You only need one account regardless of which appliances you own, and both apps work with that account simultaneously.

The apps differ in their API version: SmegConnect uses v1 endpoints while SmegConnect Plus uses v2. The main practical difference is how device state is encoded — ovens expose readable named fields (`doorState`, `childlock`, `appl`), whereas blast chillers use compact bit arrays (`applState1_*`, `applState2_*`) that require decoding. This integration handles that decoding automatically using the bit map extracted from the SmegConnect Plus APK.

**This integration uses v1 endpoints for everything.** The v1 device listing returns all enrolled appliances regardless of which app provisioned them, and v1 commands work for both ovens and blast chillers. You do not need to provision devices via any particular app — whichever app you used to set up your appliance, this integration will find and control it.

For the full API and protocol details — endpoints, command codes, state fields, bit decoding — see [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md).

## Prerequisites

1. **A SmegConnect account** — create one in the SmegConnect or SmegConnect Plus app.
2. **Enrolled appliances** — each appliance must be provisioned into your account via the official app before the integration can discover it.

---

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant: **HACS → ⋮ → Custom repositories**
2. Add URL: `https://github.com/aleks-mariusz/smegconnect-homeassistant` — Category: **Integration**
3. Search for "SmegConnect" in HACS and install
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/smeg/` to your HA `config/custom_components/smeg/` directory and restart.

---

## Configuration

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → SmegConnect**
2. Enter your SmegConnect account email and password
3. The integration logs in, discovers all enrolled appliances, and creates a device for each one

Devices are named using the full commercial product code, e.g.:
- `Smeg Pyrolytic SteamOne Oven / 60 cm / Dolce Stil Novo`
- `Smeg Multisense Blast Chiller / 45 cm / Dolce Stil Novo`

## Remote Control — Important

Many operational commands (oven power, light, cooking temperature) require **Remote Control** to be enabled on the appliance's physical display. This is separate from the app and must be set on the device itself.

**To enable:** On the oven display, navigate to the connectivity/remote settings menu (varies by model — typically a Wi-Fi or phone icon, long-press or menu button) and enable "Remote Control" or "SmegConnect". You will see the `Remote Control Enabled` diagnostic sensor in HA flip to **On**.

**Commands that require Remote Control ON:**
- Oven power on/off
- Oven light
- Keep Warm

**Commands that work regardless of Remote Control state:**
- All settings (temperature format, clock font, brightness, sound, eco modes, timers, etc.)

**Opening the door disables Remote Control.** When you open the oven or blast chiller door, the `remoteControl` field is set to OFF by the firmware as a safety measure. You must close the door and re-enable Remote Control on the display before sending operational commands again.

**Child lock blocks Remote Control.** When Child Lock is active, the firmware silently ignores remote operational commands (the API returns 202 Accepted but the appliance does nothing). To restore remote control, disable Child Lock — either via the HA switch entity or on the physical display. Note: if the lock was engaged physically on the display, you may need to disengage it there first before remote commands are accepted.

## Real-time Updates

The integration uses **STOMP over WebSocket** (`wss://ws.prod-platform.smegconnect.com/register/websocket`) for real-time state pushes. When connected, entity states update within 1–5 seconds of a physical change. If the WebSocket disconnects, the integration automatically falls back to **10-second REST polling** and attempts to reconnect (with exponential backoff: 30s → 60s → 120s → max 5 minutes).

## Supported Models

All 80 SmegConnect/SmegConnect Plus supported models are in the integration's catalog. Device names are automatically derived from the internal model number → commercial code mapping extracted from the SmegConnect Plus app.

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **Cloud-only** — the CB firmware shuts down its local HTTPS API after provisioning. All runtime control is via the Smeg cloud; no local control path exists.
- **Oven 2 (4G AUX variant)** — devices with a CB v0.0.0 or 4G auxiliary module may not provision via the standard flow. Contact Smeg support.
- **PARSW number** (e.g. PARSW0436) — this is static ADF metadata not returned by the live API; only the PARSW version number is available.
- **Firmware upgrade status** — no sensor for pending OTA updates; planned for a future release.

---

## Planned / In Progress

- **Blast chiller program select** — 10 named chilling programs (Blast Chilling, Freezing, Drinks Cooling, etc.) with confirmed program IDs; implementation in progress
- **Dishwasher support** — entity definitions and field mappings from APK analysis are complete; needs testing with a real device
- **Wine cooler support** — single and dual-zone models planned; needs testing with a real device
- **HACS default store submission** — planned once the integration reaches broader stability
- **Second oven variant (4G AUX module)** — pending resolution of a CB firmware initialisation issue with Smeg support
